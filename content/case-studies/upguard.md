## The Client

One of our largest clients is a student travel company calledÂ CIEE. They send a few thousand students around the world throughout the year for exchange or experiential programs.

We don't want to solely become a humanitarian/student travel company, but many of these companies suit us because they have travel at their core and need complex coordination, but don't want to book travel themselves (they focus on the in-country experience).

## The Challenge

What was the challenge?

- 1000s of students traveling in groups of 10-50 to 6 continents

- Each student booking separately, at different times, on their own credit cards
- Support required on travel day, when up to 1000 pax travel on the same day
- Most students are under 18 years old, which presents unique challenges
